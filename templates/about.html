      <h1 class="text-left">About Jason Ernst</h1>
      <p class="text-left">
        I'm Jason, senior software engineer at a robotics startup in the Bay
        Area.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        Prior to this I was the CTO and first developer at a startup in
        Vancouver called RightMesh which was building a mesh networking library
        for Android phones. During this time I was also an adjunct professor at
        the University of Guelph and was the industrial PI of a $2.13M MITACS
        grant to improve connectivity in Northern Canada, specifically Rigolet.
        RightMesh raised $30M in an ICO in 2018.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        Before that I was the CTO of Redtree Robotics which was working
        on a robotics hardware software platform to enable plug-and-play swarm
        robotics. I started this company with a friend during grad school and
        we raised some seed funding from Real Ventures.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        I've won, sponsored, and mentored hackathons. I love to give talks and
        present papers.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        I also enjoy driving, working on cars, video games, contributing to
        open source, cycling, running, and travel.
